# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
A basic and conceptual Machine Learning model created using logistic regression predictive system.

This ML project involves complete understanding of the core concepts of machine learning. it helps in understanding how a prediction is done on a given dataset after data preprocessing and cleaning. 

various python libraries are used in this project that helps in faster and more efficient way of handling machine learning problems related to data processing.
Though it is a very basic project it helps in clearing doubts related to efficient implementation of techinques that are used to make a predictive system.
